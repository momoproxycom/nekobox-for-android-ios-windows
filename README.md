Check Your IP Address
Visit a website like ipinfo.io to check your IP address. If the proxy is active, your IP should appear as the one from the proxy server, not your real IP.

Test Your Internet Speed
Run a speed test on sites like fast.com or Speedtest.net. For example, a result might show 25Mbps download speed, 262ms unloaded latency, and 423ms loaded latency.
